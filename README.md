# Attack Prediction Project

This project is designed to predict and classify various types of attacks based on their features. We've used six different machine learning algorithms for this purpose: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree. Additionally, we've conducted a comparative analysis of these algorithms to evaluate their performance.

## Overview

In today's digital world, cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated. Predicting and classifying attacks accurately is essential for cybersecurity. This project aims to predict whether an attack has occurred and, if so, which type of attack it is. 

## Dataset

We've used a dataset that contains information about various attacks and their features. This dataset is crucial for training and evaluating our machine learning models. link for the same: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lailahalman/mcad-sdn"
